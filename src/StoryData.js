        As he nears, the figure unveils their countenance, revealing the features of the recluse historian known as Theodric. Theodric's eyes, carrying the weight of ages past, lock onto the young man's, and in that moment, a silent understanding passes between themâ€”an unspoken dialogue that transcends mere words.
        
        With a deliberate motion, Theodric hands the young man an aged, worn-out map, its edges frayed with time. His voice, seasoned with wisdom and mystery, breaks the silence. "The answers you seek lie within the ruins nestled deep in the forest," Theodric begins, his tone measured and resonant. "It is your destiny to uncover these truths and continue onward with your journey into the unfamiliar lands that await."
        
        The young man's senses sharpen, his curiosity and determination ignited by Theodric's direct guidance. There's a weightiness to Theodric's words, an aura of significance that amplifies the young man's understanding of the gravity of his quest.`,

"It is your destiny to unravel the mysteries concealed within the ruins," he begins, his voice carrying a somber tone. "But I am bound by restrictions imposed upon me by the encroaching darkness. My support can only extend to the confines of this momentâ€”a mere fraction of the aid you seek."
